TO DO 28/12/2019:

    - Add linear and logarithmic regression to plot_patient_donning_all_s_1_5_10_14
        and plot_patient_donning_p2_p5_p8_s_all. Include r^2 values and equations.
    - perform Wicoxson signed rank test on NASA workload, stress, and
        satisfaction first training last training for patients and for carers
    - For ROM, take the single maximum value of each patient initial (and final if exists)
        for L and R and plot as histogram with extension being a negative bar, and flexion
        being a positive bar. Make initial and final assessment values for one patient
        be clearly grouped together next to each other and other patients' values be further
        off on the same plot.

TO DO 02/03/2020:

    - Check and plot data
        * Check that all data in FES times in all patients is >1s. If not, give details about
        in which patient and which session there is a value <1s.

        * Plot FES times across all patients for first 5 sessions as boxplot, i.e. first box =
        all trials from first session from all patients for whom the data is available

        ** When plotting the above print (not on plot) the number of data points which were used and from how many
            patients for each box.

    - Plot OT NASA TLX workload as boxplot like this:
        x axis labels FES, BCI, BCIFES1, BCIFES2
        in general session 1=FES, session 2=BCI, session 3= BCIFES1, sess 4= BCIFES2
        BUT since OT1 and OT3 have 5 sessions total..
        For OT1 use session 3 as BCIFES1 and session 4 as BCIFES2
        For OT3 use session 4 as BCIFES1 and session 5 as BCIFES2
        AND
        For OT4 use session 2 as FES, and session 1 as BCI.


    - plot boxplot of final threshold values from all sessions for each patient

    - Edit boxplot of plot_patient_donning_all_s_1_5_10_14 with log reg and wilcoxon to add OT
        donning onto the same plot. Use colour coding and add legend to differentiate between
        OT and patient
