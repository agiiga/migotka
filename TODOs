TO DO 23/04/2020:
- Plot boxplot TPR for sessions 1-5 for all patients grouped together
- Plot patient and carer stress for first and last training in one boxplot
- Plot patient and carer satisfaction for first and last training in one boxplot
- For boxplot plot_patient_and_ot_donning_all_s_1_5_10_14 make the last training point for patients
    be still  labelled as last training but the actual numerical value used to calculate regression be
    4.43 (i.e. average of the session numbers which were last training sessions). Readjust regression equation
    parameters to reflect this change.
