TO DO 28/12/2019:

    - Add linear and logarithmic regression to plot_patient_donning_all_s_1_5_10_14
        and plot_patient_donning_p2_p5_p8_s_all. Include r^2 values and equations.
    - perform Wicoxson signed rank test on NASA workload, stress, and
        satisfaction first training last training for patients and for carers
    - For ROM, take the single maximum value of each patient initial (and final if exists)
        for L and R and plot as histogram with extension being a negative bar, and flexion
        being a positive bar. Make initial and final assessment values for one patient
        be clearly grouped together next to each other and other patients' values be further
        off on the same plot.

TO DO 14/03/2020:
- change plot_average_tpr_for_each_patient to plot not average percentage but range of tpr for each patient
    and same for fdr

- When plotting plot_carer_patient_stress_and_satisfaction_first_last_and_independent
    print (not on plot) the number of datapoints each box is representing
